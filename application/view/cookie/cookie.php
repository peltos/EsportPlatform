            <ol>
                <li>A cookie is a file containing an identifier (a string of letters and numbers) that is sent by a web
                    server to a web browser and is stored by the browser. The identifier is then sent back to the server
                    each time the browser requests a page from the server.
                </li>
                <li>Cookies may be either "persistent" cookies or "session" cookies: a persistent cookie will be stored
                    by a
                    web browser and will remain valid until its set expiry date, unless deleted by the user before the
                    expiry date; a session cookie, on the other hand, will expire at the end of the user session, when
                    the
                    web browser is closed.
                </li>
                <li>Cookies do not typically contain any information that personally identifies a user, but personal
                    information that we store about you may be linked to the information stored in and obtained from
                    cookies.
                </li>
